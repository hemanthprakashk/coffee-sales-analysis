# Objective
This project analyzes daily transaction data from a coffee shop operating in three locations. The goal is to extract actionable sales insights based on date, store location, and product categories.

# Missing Data Simulation
Since the original dataset had no missing values, some column values were randomly set to null using Python in order to perform missing data analysis in SQL.

# Step 1: Table Creation  
First, we created the table schema to match the structure of the CSV file for importing the data.

# Step 2: Data Cleaning  
The dataset's data types and missing values were handled appropriately.

# Step 3: Analysis  
Analysis was performed at the store level, daily transaction level, and product level.
